# DataMining_Report
This is SupportVectorMachine project with details report using Python
This a academic project working with team of two members. Understanding the concepts of Supervised learning in the Datamining course.
Project Data:
Data prepared based on the selected recipes of muffin, cupcake and scone. Total 46 samples were
prepared for the selected recipes, out of which 18 samples are muffin, 16 samples are cupcake and
13 samples are scones. For the three recipes common ingredients were selected, which are Flour,
Milk, Sugar, Butter, Egg and Baking powder, and saved into a comma separated values (CSV).

In supervised learning , we adopt SVM(Support Vector machine).Where the data high dimensionality.
Goal : Understanding Mathematical background of Support vector machine how to classify the data with help of Linear , Non-linear Classifers.

## PLoting the Milk,Flour,Sugar,Butter,Egg,BakingPowder to make better combinations to make Cup-Cake / Muffins

Seaching for better hyperplane to differentiate the data points for making cupcake
